This is a fun project I created so I can learn how to use these different components and why not? :)

1. The idea is simple, two arduino boards each one connected to a nRF24L01P radio. What else can I do for fun though?

2. Add an LED to each board and have it lit on when data gets transfered. nice, nice. What else?

3. Add a photosensor to one of the boards and transmit data on sensor activity, now I can simulate I am
playing ping-pong (table tenis) and using a paddle I agitate the sensor which then transmits data,
and we can visualize that with the LEDs switching ON and OFF. What else?

4. Add a led matrix to keep the "score", in the other board so everytime LED is lit there (data received)
it also increments the counter and shows in the led matrix. :) 

5. What else?

TODO:

1. Test it. I wrote the code and I am yet to test it :) LOL
2. Implement item 4 (led matrix)
3. Record a video, upload to you tube and link it here
